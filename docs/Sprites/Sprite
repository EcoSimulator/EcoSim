    class Sprite(pygame.sprite.DirtySprite)
     |  Default sprite class
     |  All (move-able) sprites should inherit from this
     |  
     |  Method resolution order:
     |      Sprite
     |      pygame.sprite.DirtySprite

     |      __builtin__.object
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, image, rect, type)
     |      Initializes a blank sprite
     |      Should not be called on its own
     |          only as super in another __init__
     |      Sets health = 100 (max-health, once implemented)
     |  
     |  add_internal(self, group)
     |

     |  
     |  button_ops(self)
     |      Checks for pause menu call with ESC key
     |  
     |  hunt(self, group)

     |  
     |  move_is_within_surface(self, x_offset, y_offset)
     |      Checks whether a sprite's move keeps it within the bounds of the screen

     |  Data descriptors inherited from pygame.sprite.DirtySprite:
     |

     |  Methods inherited from pygame.sprite.Sprite:
     |  
     |  add(self, *groups)
     |      add the sprite to groups
     |      Sprite.add(*groups): return None
     |      
     |      Any number of Group instances can be passed as arguments. The 
     |      Sprite will be added to the Groups it is not already a member of.
     |  
     |  alive(self)
     |      does the sprite belong to any groups
     |      Sprite.alive(): return bool
     |      
     |      Returns True when the Sprite belongs to one or more Groups.
     |  
     |  groups(self)
     |      list of Groups that contain this Sprite
     |      Sprite.groups(): return group_list

     |      Return a list of all the Groups that contain this Sprite.
     |  
     |  kill(self)
     |      remove the Sprite from all Groups
     |      Sprite.kill(): return None
     |      
     |      The Sprite is removed from all the Groups that contain it. This won't
     |      change anything about the state of the Sprite. It is possible to continue
     |      to use the Sprite after this method has been called, including adding it
     |      to Groups.
     |  
     |  remove(self, *groups)
     |      remove the sprite from groups
     |      Sprite.remove(*groups): return None
     |      
     |      Any number of Group instances can be passed as arguments. The Sprite will
     |      be removed from the Groups it is currently a member of.
