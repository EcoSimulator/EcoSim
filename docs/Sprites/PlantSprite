     |  Methods inherited from pygame.sprite.Sprite:
     |
     |  add(self, *groups)
     |      add the sprite to groups
     |      Sprite.add(*groups): return None
     |
     |      Any number of Group instances can be passed as arguments. The
     |      Sprite will be added to the Groups it is not already a member of.
     |
     |  alive(self)
     |      does the sprite belong to any groups
     |      Sprite.alive(): return bool
     |
     |      Returns True when the Sprite belongs to one or more Groups.

     |
     |      The Sprite is removed from all the Groups that contain it. This won't
     |      change anything about the state of the Sprite. It is possible to continue

     |      to Groups.
