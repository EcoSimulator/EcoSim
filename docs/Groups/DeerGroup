    class DeerGroup(pygame.sprite.Group)
     |  Group for deer sprites
     |  Group Name = "deer"

     |  
     |  __len__(self)
     |      len(group)
     |      number of sprites in group
     |      
     |      Returns the number of sprites contained in the group.

     |      argument should be Surface which is the same
     |      dimensions as the surface. The bgd can also be
     |      a function which gets called with the passed
     |      surface and the area to be cleared.
     |  
     |  copy(self)
     |      copy()
     |      copy a group with all the same sprites

     |      ask if group has a sprite or sprites
     |      
     |      Returns true if the given sprite or sprites are

     |  has_internal(self, sprite)
     |  
     |  remove(self, *sprites)
     |      remove(sprite, list, or group, ...)
     |      remove sprite from group

     |      sprites()
     |      get a list of sprites in the group
     |      
     |      Returns an object that can be looped over with a 'for' loop.
     |      (For now it is always a list, but newer version of Python
     |      could return different iterators.) You can also iterate directly
     |      over the sprite group.
